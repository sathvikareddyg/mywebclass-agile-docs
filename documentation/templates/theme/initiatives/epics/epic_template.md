Title of the Epic: "Establishing a Pull Process and Ensuring Compliance for MyWebClass Product Development"

Description: This epic aims to develop a "pull" process for the development of the MyWebClass product and minimize or eliminate the amount of "push" in the MyWebClass.org project. The goal is to measure the effectiveness of the product quantitatively, which also allows us to legally use Google Analytics to measure user behaviour on the site, and ensure compliance with w3c validation, Lighthouse, and GDPR Scanner.

Goals:
1. To develop a "pull" process for the development of the MyWebClass product
2. To measure the effectiveness of the product quantitatively using Google Analytics
3. To ensure compliance with w3c validation, Lighthouse, and GDPR Scanner

User Stories:
1. As a product owner, I want to establish a "pull" process for the development of the MyWebClass product so that the team can work more efficiently.
2. As a developer, I want to integrate Google Analytics into the MyWebClass.org site so that we can measure user behaviour.
3. As a developer, I want to ensure that the MyWebClass.org site complies with w3c validation, Lighthouse, and GDPR Scanner so that we can avoid legal issues.

Dependencies:
1. Integration of Google Analytics into the MyWebClass.org site
2. Implementation of w3c validation, Lighthouse, and GDPR Scanner on the MyWebClass.org site

Risks:
1. Difficulty in implementing the "pull" process
2. Technical challenges in integrating Google Analytics into the site
3. Legal issues related to compliance with GDPR

Mitigation Strategies:
1. Collaborate with the development team to establish an effective "pull" process
2. Work closely with a legal expert to ensure compliance with GDPR
3. Consult with technical experts to address any technical challenges

Estimated Effort: 4-6 weeks

Business Value: The development of a "pull" process for the MyWebClass product will improve efficiency and productivity, while the implementation of Google Analytics and compliance with w3c validation, Lighthouse, and GDPR Scanner will ensure a better user experience and legal compliance.

Priority: High
