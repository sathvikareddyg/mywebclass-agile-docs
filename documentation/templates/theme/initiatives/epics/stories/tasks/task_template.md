Task 1 Title: Create course creation wizard component

User Story: As a teacher, I want to be able to create a new course on MyWebClass.org so that I can share my knowledge and expertise with students.

Description: Create a new component that will provide a course creation wizard for the teacher. The wizard will guide the teacher through the process of creating a new course and will allow them to add a course title, description, and objectives. The component should also allow the teacher to upload course materials, such as videos, documents, and quizzes. The component should validate required fields and uploaded file types and display an error message if the teacher leaves any required fields blank or uploads invalid file types. The course should be automatically published after the teacher completes the course creation wizard, and the course should be listed on the platform's course catalog. Automated testing with Playwright and pytest should be implemented to ensure that the course creation wizard works as expected.

Task 2 Title: Add undo functionality to course editing interface

User Story: As a teacher, I want to be able to undo my changes in the course editing interface on MyWebClass.org so that I can easily revert any mistakes.

Description:

Add an "undo" button to the course editing interface that allows teachers to revert their changes to the previous state.
Ensure that the "undo" functionality works correctly with all course materials, including videos, documents, and quizzes. Make sure that the undo functionality is only enabled for teachers and not any other roles.
Add automated testing with Playwright and pytest to ensure that the "undo" functionality works as expected.
