"As a web development team member, I want to develop the MyWebClass product in a way that attracts users organically and test its effectiveness, so that we can continually improve the user experience. By incorporating quantitative measures, we can assess the effectiveness of the MyWebClass.org project. This will enable us to continuously improve the site's usability and engagement.
By utilizing the AGILE methodology, we can quickly develop and implement changes based on user feedback. By adhering to web development principles such as responsive design, accessibility, and SEO optimization, we can ensure that the site is user-friendly and easy to find through search engines.
This approach will enable us to deliver high-quality project deliverables, including a website that passes W3C validation, Lighthouse performance audits, and GDPR compliance. By continuously testing and improving the site, we can set ourselves up for long-term benefits, including increased user engagement, higher search engine rankings, and improved user experience."
